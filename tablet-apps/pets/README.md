This is a tablet app for the [Overte](https://overte.org/) social VR platform that allows you to create a 3D pet that follows and accompanies you. Each pet is fully animated, and its colors are randomly generated when the pet is created.

If you don't like your pet's randomly selected colors, simply create a new pet until you get one you like.


**KNOWN BUGS:** 
- If you manually delete any of the model or materal entities created by this app, you may encounter glitches with duplicate "ghost" models. The ghost models usually disappear after a server restart, though.
