This is a tablet app for the [Overte](https://overte.org/) social VR platform that allows you to create a 3D pet that follows and accompanies you. Each pet is animated, and its colors are randomly generated upon creation.

If you don't like your pet's randomly selected colors, simply create a new pet until you get one you like.


**KNOWN BUGS:** 
- If you manually delete any of the model or materal entities created by this app, you may encounter glitches with duplicate "ghost" models. The ghost models usually disappear after a server restart, though.
