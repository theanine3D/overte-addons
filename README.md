This is a tablet app for the [Overte](https://overte.org/) social VR platform that allows you to create a 3D pet that follows and accompanies you. Each pet is animated, and its colors are randomly generated upon creation.

See the [readme](https://github.com/theanine3D/overte-addons/tree/main/pets) for more information.
