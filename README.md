# overte-addons
My personal collection of scripts, shaders, and addons for the open source social VR platform, [Overte](https://overte.org/).

## Pets

This is a tablet app for the [Overte](https://overte.org/) social VR platform that allows you to create a 3D pet that follows and accompanies you. Each pet is animated, and its colors are randomly generated upon creation.

See the [readme](https://github.com/theanine3D/overte-addons/tree/main/DayNight_System) for more information.

## Day/Night System

This is a scripted day/night system for  [Overte](https://overte.org/). Setup is designed to be as simple as possible, easy enough even for people who aren't programmers. Once setup in the scene, the script will automatically modify the sky/lighting throughout the scene, based on your local time of day. Unlike other day/night systems, this one doesn't use any custom shaders, instead making use of a combination of UV offsetting, skeletal animation, and script code to pull off the effect.
